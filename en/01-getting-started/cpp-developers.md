## C++ developers
If  you are doing C++ development you will need __Cocos Creator__, a C++ compiler, a working __Cocos2d-x__ installation, a text editor and knowledge of using a shell (also called the command-line).

To install __Cocos Creator__, please refer to the official [installation guide](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/creator/manual/en/getting-started/introduction.html).

Your host system will need a C++ compiler. Each platform has many options. Please Google for instructions.

Possible text editors include: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Web Storm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/features/) and pretty much any text editor that you are comfortable with.
