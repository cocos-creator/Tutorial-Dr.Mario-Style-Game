## Laying out the game user interface
Now that we have a menu screen that players will use to start out game, we need to give them something to play. Let's start building the core logic of our game. To do this we will layout the user interface first, then add components and code to make the game playable.__Cocos Creator__ promotes a true team workflow by allowing __artists__ and __developers__ to work together on a project at the same time. Artists can work inside __Cocos Creator__ to so `Scene` layout while the developers can be adding and testing game play code. They don't step on each others toes.

We are going to be repeating concepts that we learned in chapter 3, so there wont be as much explanation for these steps. Refer back to chapter 3 if you get stuck.
